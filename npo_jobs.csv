Co-founder wanted for tech business startup

Are you a the savvy self starter looking to join/build a startup? Do you have high level skills which you feel under-compensated for, or feel you could be doing more with whether in your spare time or your sole venture? This may be the spot for you!

The Company is in it's infancy, white boards and work flow charts along with extensive internal market research and my own experience. I am seeking specifically a partner who will compliment my shortcomings in the tech side of this venture. I have the vision, the drive, and the finances to fund the launch. The company is a software/HR/supplemental hiring company that will be web based to be used by companies such as Indeed, Careerbuilder and the U.S. government for candidates seeking employment/job surfing. It is designed to bridge a missing link within the hiring process for the private sector. The reason this gap exists is because of the lack the lack of skilled employees in today's market place among virtually all industries. The secondary function relates specifically to unemployment for the government. This platform is designed to save business' and the tax payers both time and huge sums of money. Preliminary numbers from within my industry assume 10-18k per year per company. Larger scale companies such as law and finance stand to save in excess of 30k annually as a result. Billable's for this company are to be generated first by ad traffic, and by annual subscription. With nearly 28 MILLION registered business' in the US, the market for this is very real, and the demand high. I personally struggle with what this problem would solve daily, and a lot of my colleagues agree we have a real problem.  Add to that the nearly 6 MILLION people (which by the way is VERY LOW historically) on unemployment and the vision suddenly transcends my wildest dreams for opportunity.  I'd be willing to explore other avenues of revenue generation outside of the ones I am currently aware of.

I'm not paid to be a founder. Neither will I pay you. But you'll own part of the company, with the additional benefits of:
1) the excitement and satisfaction that comes with being a startup founder
2) the multitudes of priceless skills you'll develop that will be your asset forever
3) the gratification of building something from nothing, for your own company
4) the opportunity to work with and learn from super driven and talented people- whom we will choose together 
5) the deep knowing every day that you're living your highest potential

Qualifications:
Preferred-Proficient - Advanced skills in coding and website design
Preferred- Proficient - Advanced skills in App integration/development
General understanding of google ad-words and Social Media Marketing

The right candidate is:
Independent
Self-starter
Highly motivated
Willing to self-educate
Willing to sign a NDA and Non-Compete
Willing to work unpaid in exchange for equity stake

The job description is vast, and admittedly not fully understood. A candidate looking to operate within a cube with constant direction will not find it here. You have an entrepreneurial drive, a passion for and full understanding of the vision, the ability to work just as well independently as well as part of a team. An understanding of where you are weak so that we can highlight them and ensure we get either 1) the support we need identified upfront, or 2) an area for us both to focus on and self-educate in order to move forward. The ideal candidate is available to commit a minimum 15+ hours per week from home with face to face meetings weekly. Equity stake is based on experience, and results which we will outline clearly.

About me:
Visionary
Seasoned HR and Production and Hiring Manager
Small startup experience (2 small companies non tech)
Marketing and sales experience
Currently employed- this is a side project for me, which I am looking to partner, burn the boats (Kudos if you're up on this reference) and go at this full time. In order for me to do that we need to establish a relationship, and a product with billable's.

What you can expect from me/ this process.

1st interview - by phone. My goal is to gain an understanding about you and what you are looking for and answer the questions that I can for you at this point
2nd interview - by phone. My goal here will be to gain answers to questions from the first phone interview and set up an in-person interview
3rd interview -in Person. Our goal is to see if we click, maybe an activity. You can expect to get a glimpse of the vision and have some small tasks assigned to you as part of the interview process. You can expect to be presented with two documents. 1) a non-disclosure 2) a non-compete
4th interview- in person. Our goal will be to see if the spark is there, is there passion for this vision on your end and understand the core competencies we would have combined and where the shortfalls might be.

At this point I expect to have a couple of candidates from which to review.

Please promptly reply to this ad to set up a time for us to meet along with your resume, education/background, any relevant startup experience and availability to dedicate to this project.

I look forward to speaking with and learning more about you!

Cloud-based program that 
* Scrapes 5 specific websites with hundreds of thousands of pages each (with similarly structured data)
* Creates structured database of ~40 columns of data
* Simple front end interface that can be plugged into WP site
* Output includes simple interface with line chart capability

I can explain more of the specifics or answer any questions as needed. I am tech-familiar but not deeply knowledgeable on databases, so I can explain exactly what I need to happen but not necessarily how to make it work so I'll look for you to design it in a simple way. I can provide a suggested header list with sources for each header. I'll also look to you to recommend which services are best to host.    "

[This is a unique opportunity for a unique person - so please read the whole thing and only apply if you meet the criteria]

•	Are you a highly gifted software developer who would love to team up with someone skilled at marketing what you can build?

•	Do you want to be part of a startup team that builds something amazing - and share in the rewards? 

•	Do you have a high level of skill or expertise in the field of AI, NLP/NLU or relevant to coding chatbots? 

•	Do you have another source of income and the ability to devote flexible hours to a startup effort?

IF so, we have an interesting opportunity.

This is Not a job.  
Sorry we can't pay you market rate, or offer you a 401k and a cubicle.  We can't even pay you - yet. 

This is an entrepreneurial opportunity.

I'm the CEO of a startup and my expertise is selling and marketing technical products (I've sold over $25 million USD worth of technical products to organizations like NASA, Raytheon, Gannett, etc.).  

I am a 'full-stack' businessperson but not a developer.  I need to find the right person to help us significantly increase the value of our tech platform.  We (myself and our small team) have managed to secure customers in 3 countries and over 30 industries.  We're also in trials with large partner firms.  We have real opportunity - not just theories.  But, we're self-funded and have minimal revenue so we are not looking at hiring yet - we're looking to build a startup team to grow and share the 'pie'.  

Depending on your situation this could be full time, part time, or 'side-hustle'. 
We only ask that you can contribute at least 10 hrs/week of quality work that you can do remotely and flexibly.  

This would be an excellent fit for someone with the required skill-set and the intention to have an ongoing relationship and/or the desire to play a key role in a startup. Examples might include: freelancers, students in M.S. or PhD programs, professors, full-time employees looking for a flexible on-going 'side-hustle' opportunity, etc.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
➢	At this time we are looking for candidates who live in the U.S. ONLY
➢	At this time we are not offering monetary compensation at start.  It's a startup - before we can pay, you have to help us build our tech so we can sell more and increase revenue.  Or, help us to get an investor.
➢	NO Agencies, individuals Only

Requirements:
•	Expertise in one or more of the following: Artificial intelligence, coding chatbots, NLP, NLU, Machine Learning
•	Based physically in the United States
•	Legally eligible to work in the USA
•	You have another source of income OR can support yourself for several months (please do not apply if you need full time income right away!)
•	Willing to work for equity OR bonus based on future revenue
•	You deliver quality
•	You are trustworthy, hardworking, and reliable
•	You can work remotely and independently and get sh*t done quickly

Ideal Qualifications:
• 	High level of expertise with NLP algorithms, tools, and techniques
•	Strong programming skills 
•	1+ years working on a chatbot or similar text-based NLP application
•	High level of understanding of chatbot architecture
•	Solid, trustworthy team player who delivers on time
•	Experience with PHP and Laravel
•	Ability to quickly learn and apply a full-stack- approach
•	Process orientation - you build things that last and scale
•	Based in Massachusetts or New England
•	Degree from top school in the US, Canada, or Europe
•	M.S. or PhD. in Computer Science
•	Expertise with Rasa.ai, Watson or other NLP libraries
•	Added skills in machine learning, data science, etc.
•	Impeccable written and verbal English communication skills


If you have the expertise we are looking for let's talk. 

PLEASE DO NOT APPLY UNLESS YOU MEET THE CRITERIA.

IF you meet the criteria, apply ONCE.  Send us a resume or even just a couple paragraphs why you might fit.   We'll contact interesting people within a week. Thanks!

I know the type of person we're looking for is going to require us to prove we're worth the investment of your time. No problem.  I'm happy to have candid conversations with the right people. 


About us:
We're a small, young tech company that has successfully deployed autonomous bots in 3 countries for dozens of industries. We have bootstrapped growth through partnerships and customer acquisition and would like to add talented members to our team and grow significantly.

Software Programmer Developer - SQL PHP

We have an opportunity available to bring on a new developer to our team. We are open minded to experienced developers as well as entry level self-starters. Salary range would depend on experience and fit but would ballpark $60k-$100k to start
Company size: approximately 40 people
Full Time - on-site (not remote) 8:30am-5pm
Benefits
Milford - Hopedale - Bellingham area (specific location and details only given after passing initial phone interview)

Experienced developers: Ideally, we want an experienced developer who can come in read the current code and jump right in. We have an entire payment & database system already developed we are just adding modules and making it better!

Self-starters: We are interested in young individuals with a solid base for development skill and a passion to learn more. We do not have the time or staff to teach you, this is why I want to emphasize self-starter! The expectation would be us giving you a project and you using reasonable amount of time at work to research and learn the skills needed and if necessary, put it hours on your time to get yourself up to speed in the environment you are developing in. 

Secure coding is an absolute must, so please if you feel you have some unique methodology, we are not the company for you. As a payment site we require our developers to code up to industry standards. All code is reviewed before being pushed to a live system, which also means (eventually) you will be reviewing others code also.

I've given you two critical languages we use (SQL and PHP), your first test is in your application! We are looking for you to ask a few questions to show us you read the description and you are interested! If your resume comes over and doesn't say something specific about this ad or a question about what programming languages we use YOUR APPLICATION WILL BE IGNORED.

We are a firm believer in prove your worth! We will bring you in and if you show value then we want you to do well and we want you to grow with us. If we bring you in and your all sales pitch and no skill we do review after the first 60 days and we have let people go before. This is not a place you will be under the radar, everyone knows everyone, and we count on each other for growth. When we work together, we all win.
